Compile with: gcc -Wall -O2 -g -o magnet magnet.c -lfcgi -llua -lm -ldl -pedantic -ansi -std=c99

Associate the .lua extension with the `magnet` fastcgi launcher in your web server.

Features (so far)
-----------------

	- Caches scripts under _G.magnet.cache['<script>']
	- Keeps track of how many hits each script gets (_G.magnet.cache['<script'].hits)
	- Also exports the mtime for each script (which it uses to re-cache automagically if it has been altered)

	>> I take no credit for these.

Tip
---

You can check out the interesting CGI environment variables with
os.getenv('REQUEST_URI') or os.getenv('QUERY_STRING'), etc... it's
just up to you to parse said query string.  I've already done
something in pure Lua which you can view at http://partyvan.us/bleh.lua,
the source is icky and found under http://partyvan.us/sources/cgi-env.lua

List of CGI Environment Variables
---------------------------------

	- 'AUTH_TYPE'
	- 'CONTENT_LENGTH'
	- 'CONTENT_TYPE'
	- 'DOCUMENT_ROOT'
	- 'GATEWAY_INTERFACE'
	- 'HTTP_ACCEPT'
	- 'HTTP_COOKIE'
	- 'HTTP_HOST'
	- 'HTTP_REFERRER'
	- 'HTTP_USER_AGENT'
	- 'HTTPS'
	- 'PATH'
	- 'PATH_INFO'
	- 'PATH_TRANSLATED'
	- 'QUERY_STRING',
	- 'REMOTE_ADDR'
	- 'REMOTE_HOST'
	- 'REMOTE_IDENT'
	- 'REMOTE_USER'
	- 'REQUEST_METHOD'
	- 'REQUEST_URI'
	- 'SCRIPT_NAME'
	- 'SCRIPT_FILENAME'
	- 'SERVER_ADMIN'
	- 'SERVER_NAME'
	- 'SERVER_PORT'
	- 'SERVER_PROTOCOL',
	- 'SERVER_SIGNATURE'
	- 'SERVER_SOFTWARE'

	- Note: Please let me know if there is some standard for all
	that exist, I have checked the original CGI site, but I keep
	finding more standard-yet-non-standard conventional CGI vars
	exported by my webserver.  Just curious what is common.

Roadmap
-------

	DO WANT:
		- Export all the CGI environment variables under magnet.env
			- Find out the standard for parsing the QUERY_STRING if it is defined. -.-
				- I believe ; or & is the (conventional?) record separator... need more info.
		- Expose some number showing the total FastCGI requests handled. (easy)

	Low Priority: (luaFilesystem works spendidly for now)
		- Add a function for listing a directory which returns a table *cough*array*cough* of the contents.
		- Add a function for stat()'ing a file.  Return the usual struct as a table.
